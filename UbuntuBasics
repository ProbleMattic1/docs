1. Install Docker Engine (if not already installed): 
First, update your package list and install necessary dependencies: 
Code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
Add Docker's official GPG key: 
Code
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
Set up the Docker repository: 
Code
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
Update your package list again and install Docker Engine: 
Code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin

2. Install Docker Compose Plugin: 
Install the Docker Compose plugin directly through apt: 
Code
sudo apt install docker-compose-plugin

3. Verify Installation: 
Check the installed versions of Docker and Docker Compose: 
Code
docker --version
docker compose version


Use the following command to add user to docker group:
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
This command appends your user to the docker group, allowing permission to access the Docker daemon files and directories.

After adding your user to the group, you must log out and log back in for the new group membership to take effect. Alternatively, you can run the following command to log in to a new group:
newgrp docker

You can check if your user has docker group membership by running:
groups

Once done, try running one of the docker commands:
docker ps

Code

    sudo ufw app list

sudo ufw allow 'Apache Full'

sudo systemctl status apache2

    sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

 ServerName localhost
